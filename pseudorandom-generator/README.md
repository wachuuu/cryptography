# Blum Blum Shub Algorithm

Implemented BBS pseudo random generator and basic `FIPS 140-2` tests to check whether pseudorandom streams are secure and non periodical.

There are some sample 20k bit long streams saved in `.txt` files (`20k_X.txt`).

Test output for these three files is stored in `testout.txt`.
